                Instructional Model: Forum, Panel, and Symposium (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 405-423)
                <p>
                    A forum is when a group of about 25 gather to discuss a specific topic and it is open to discussion,
                    whereas a panel is still involving a specific topic, but only 3-6 people talk with an audience and
                    the
                    audience does not typically participate until the end for questions. A symposium is when a few
                    people
                    give presentations on related topics and then there is questioning at the end, but the presenters
                    don’t
                    speak like a panel. They all allow for the public to give opinion and ask questions, while the
                    “experts”
                    are able to answer the questions from the public. They are also all led by a moderator who leads
                    discussion and keeps everything flowing throughout. The symposium is the most formal, followed by
                    the
                    forum, and then finally the panel is the least formal. During a forum, if 25 people have to try to
                    speak
                    it can be difficult, but it is useful to hear everyone’s thoughts. For a panel you get to hear
                    differing
                    opinions and to ask specific questions, but a moderator is in charge of asking those questions,
                    which
                    isn’t always a positive experience. For a symposium you once again hear differing opinions, but you
                    don’t get the active participation like a forum allows. The physical location of everyone is also
                    important for the most successful learning to take place. The audience must be able to see the main
                    speakers and be able to be heard from the speakers as well for questions. For a forum everyone
                    should be
                    able to be seen when it is their time to speak. Overall, all three of these are extremely useful at
                    different times depending on the purpose of them, the audience, and what topic is to be discussed.

                Application:
                <p>
                    For my application, I would have a panel come in to an introductory course. The panel could be a
                    variety
                    of people, but I think it would be most useful for the students to have recent graduates in their
                    respective majors come in. This would give students the opportunity to see what people in their
                    major
                    are doing for a job, if they are finding relatable positions, and what area they are working in.
                    They
                    can ask questions about their individual programs as well to feel more comfortable with moving
                    forward.
                    Recent graduates would still be fresh on what it was like to be a first year student and could give
                    great perspective to motivate them.
                </p>

                Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016 pp. 105-110)
                <p>
                    I would have the students do a quick write the week before the panel in order for them to have an
                    opportunity to write out their questions for the panel, so that I could lead discussion if they are
                    unwilling the following week. I would also be able to see what they are still struggling with and
                    having
                    questions about, so if the panel doesn’t answer for them, I could still cover it if I am able. After
                    the
                    panel, I would have them complete another quick write to see if they got all their questions
                    answered or
                    if they have any remaining questions.
