                Instructional Model: Case Study (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 383-404)
                <p>
                    A case study is the use of a scenario or case and people’s previous life experiences to solve a
                    real-world problem. They can be used to teach people on a new topic that they have never learned
                    before,
                    or a concept they are unfamiliar with. Case studies focus on a problem, dramatize real life, are
                    designed to fit the learner and the mode of delivery, they must have support materials, and it must
                    be
                    complete, so that students can understand it, but isn’t too simple. They allow the learner to really
                    think about a concept and allow it to be applied to their own lives. Case studies are best done in
                    groups, so that students can collaborate on the problems and solutions that are involved in the
                    scenario. Case studies involve thinking critical about an applicable or relatable situation. Having
                    a
                    time limit could make the situation life-like because they have to decide things quickly, or it
                    could
                    have more time taken, so that students understand it more thoroughly. Case studies can be used to
                    teach
                    any topic and in any format depending on the goal of the teaching learning interaction.

                Application:
                <p>
                    In my Finance in Higher Education course the textbook utilizes case studies and we have done one as
                    a
                    class as well. At the end of most chapters, there is a case study about Alpha University that has
                    you
                    think about as a budget manager how would you solve the issue. These are useful to actually apply
                    what
                    we have read about and see how we would react. In one evening in class we had to read a case of a
                    budget
                    issue in a university. We all then had to discuss how we would approach the situation if we were in
                    that
                    scenario. I enjoyed this activity because I got to hear everyone else’s ideas and compare how I felt
                    about the situation.

                Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016 pp. 105-110)
                <p>
                    The formative assessment for this could have been a quick write. We could have written down how we
                    felt
                    about the situation and what we learned about ourselves when making those decisions.
