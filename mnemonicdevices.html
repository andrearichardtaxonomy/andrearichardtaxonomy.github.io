                Instructional Method: Mnemonic Devices (Tate, 2012, pp. 65-70)
                <p>
                    Mnemonic devices or acronyms can be used in many aspects of education from explaining an acronym to
                    the
                    learners or also creating acronyms for easier retention later. If a student has a way to memorize
                    the
                    material and associate with something else, they have a much better chance of remembering it later.
                    The
                    brain memorizes by association and therefore, associating a topic with a sentence or specific words
                    allows easier retention. Mnemonics allow learners to learn and remember more material than if they
                    were
                    to just be told the information. The learners also remember the information for longer periods of
                    time
                    because of the way they learned the information.

                Application:
                <p>
                    In an intro course when I am covering resume, cover letter, and interviewing techniques, they are
                    many
                    acronyms that are used. For example, when interviewing we use the acronym STAR Method, which stands
                    for
                    Situation/Task Action Result. When answering an interview question, you should answer with the
                    situation
                    or task that was involved, the action you took, so what you did, and then the result of your action
                    and
                    how it resolved or ended. This helps students to think of interview answers to practice before their
                    interview and also helps them to stay on track of the question while they are answering during an
                    actual
                    interview. Another acronym similar to STAR is Action Verb + Skill + Task = Result (AVSTR). This is
                    used
                    when creating sentences on a resume for their previous work experience. You start the sentence with
                    an
                    action verb followed by a transferrable skill and the task that you had and if there was a specific
                    result that can be included. A lot of times there wasn’t necessarily a result, so that is optional.
                    This
                    allows students to break down what their skills are and how to prove those skills to an employer.
                    After
                    students get the hang of the process, they find it very useful to think about it this way.

                Assessment: Entry and Exit Tickets (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 91-95)
                <p>
                    A fun way to assess the class knowledge of the acronyms would be to have an entry and exit ticket.
                    Before class started, I would ask the students to fill out a notecard with what their current
                    knowledge
                    is on the acronyms STAR and AVSTR. At the end of the class, I would have them answer the question
                    again
                    and then turn both of them in. It would serve as their attendance and also show me what they gained
                    from
                    the lessons. The analysis shouldn’t be too high because I would just compare the before and after
                    and
                    the preparation as well as implementation would be low.
