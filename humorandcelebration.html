                Instructional Method: Humor and Celebration (Tate, 2012, pp. 47-52)
                <p>
                    Humor in the classroom can be implemented in many ways. A joke could be told, a video could be
                    shown, or
                    making fun of the assignments or yourself as an instructor. Anything that would make a student laugh
                    in
                    the classroom is considered humor in some form. Humor allows the student to relax and enjoy the
                    material
                    they are learning rather than stress about it. It also allows the student to learn better because of
                    the
                    lack of stress. I always say that humor cures everything, and in the classroom, I think this is
                    especially true. Another way to improve the classroom energy is to have celebrations. I think
                    something
                    as simple as clapping or high-fiving students when they answer a question is a celebration.
                    Celebrations
                    allow students to feel recognized for their contribution, while also validating their ideas.
                    Everyone
                    should feel welcome and safe to share their opinions and celebrations allow that. With humor and
                    celebrations, you have to be careful that you are including everyone in them and that no one is ever
                    offended. If you are to use humor, you have to make sure your joke is actually humorous and not
                    hurtful
                    to anyone in any way. You also have to be careful it doesnâ€™t single anyone out in the classroom.
                    Group
                    jokes are better than individual ones because you stand the chance of hurting an individual and
                    making
                    them feel uncomfortable with you.

                Application:
                <p>
                    A way that I really enjoy humor in a classroom is take the content and relate it to a TV show or
                    movie.
                    During lessons, I could have pre-planned clips of shows and play them throughout. This would allow
                    some
                    humor in the classroom, while also still relating to the content. I always found it useful to see it
                    related to in pop culture and then apply it to my own life. It was another way for me to have the
                    material stick and often times would clarify the topic as well. Another way to include humor would
                    be to
                    ask students a silly question as a check-in for each class. Everyone in the room has to answer the
                    silly
                    question and that would count as their participation for the day. One of my classes did this in
                    undergrad and it always get everyone laughing before class. This brought the energy level up and
                    increased the learning right from the beginning.

                Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 105-110)
                <p>
                    Instead of having them only say their answer to the silly question, I could also have them write it
                    down. That way they could turn something in and also share it to the class. The quick write could
                    even
                    be used to say if they are struggling with anything or something that is working for them on top of
                    the
                    answer to the question. This could help them get in the mindset of having fun during class, while
                    also
                    asking them a more serious question.
