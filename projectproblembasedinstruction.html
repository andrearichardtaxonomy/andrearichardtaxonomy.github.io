                Instructional Method: Project-Based and Problem-Based Instruction (Tate, 2012, pp. 85-88)
                <p>
                    Project and problem-based instruction is when learners are given the opportunity to solve real-world
                    issues. They are asked to put something together that represents their learning in a bigger picture.
                    This seems to be how a lot of grad classes are focused. Instead of being tested on materials you are
                    instead asked to show how you understand it and how it applies to you in your own context. This type
                    of
                    learning allows for purpose to be found and for learners to engage because they are interested, and
                    it
                    applies to them rather than just having to regurgitate the information for an exam. Allowing for a
                    professional learning community to form in a classroom can be extremely useful for adult learners
                    because of the learning from one another that takes place. Other viewpoints and ideas they may have
                    never thought of can come up and change how they view their own projects and contexts. Parallel
                    processing occurs in the brain when a learner is problem solving, as well as the idea of intrinsic
                    rewards for making meaning out of their learning.
                </p>
                Application:
                <p>
                    In an introductory course, project and problem-based instruction would be very useful. In
                    particular, I
                    had thought about a time management activity. Students often don’t understand how to balance their
                    schoolwork, social life, and possibly work life. I would have them get into groups and make a list
                    of
                    everything they do each day and approximately how long that takes. I would then ask they create a
                    calendar or schedule out of their tasks individually. This would help to give them a visual
                    representation of their time and how they are managing it. Students may find it isn’t very balanced
                    and
                    create a new schedule to make a balance. They have to keep in mind they can only put as much as the
                    day
                    allows and also have to allow for 8 hours of sleep. After they have completed their before and after
                    schedules, they can present them to their original group and discuss what they learned about balance
                    in
                    their lives. This gives them the chance to take what we have learned about time management and apply
                    it
                    to their own lives and even use it in their future to stay on track and remember what is important.
                    They
                    also would get to hear from others and understand they are not alone in the struggle of balancing
                    their
                    lives. I would have them turn in their calendars/schedules at the end of class as well, so that I
                    could
                    see how well they did.
                </p>

                Assessment:
                <p>
                    The formative assessment would be their presentations to their group mates. I would be walking
                    around
                    the room throughout the activity and their presentations to gauge how they are understanding and
                    applying the concepts. I should be able to see by their actual calendars how they grasped the
                    concepts
                    as well.
