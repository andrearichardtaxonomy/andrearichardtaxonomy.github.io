                Instructional Model: Demonstration and Simulation (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 361-381)
                <p>
                    A demonstration is used to allow students to be able to try or model a task that will help them to
                    further understand the concept. There are five types of demonstration instructor, participant
                    volunteer,
                    full participation, job instruction training, and behavior modeling. A demonstration must be done in
                    a
                    way that ensures the learner fully understands the steps and what is expected of them as well as
                    that
                    they are able to actually see the demonstration. Demonstration allow for a concept to become
                    concrete
                    because they have done it themselves and can apply it to their own life then. They will have gained
                    the
                    knowledge and skill necessary to complete the task. Making sure the learners know they won’t be
                    perfect
                    the first try or that they can practice is necessary to avoid them having negative feelings about
                    the
                    activity. Everyone should enjoy the learning process. A simulation is an activity allowing a learner
                    to
                    try a real-life situation in a classroom without having anything negative happen. Curiosity and
                    growth
                    of the learner are the only outcomes since it is a simulation. The instructor must have had this
                    experience before in order to do the simulation, but it is extremely useful for learners to get the
                    full
                    exposure to the concept by being active learners. The learners are also emotionally involved which
                    helps
                    them to fully understand a topic and remember how it made them feel. Simulations must be done in a
                    way
                    that allows the learner to only learn not feel they aren’t good enough or lose confidence. It can’t
                    be
                    too complex as to lose the learner. Simulations are also expensive and time consuming, which must be
                    taken into account by the educator.

                Application:
                <p>
                    A demonstration in an introductory course, could involve interviewing techniques. Students could
                    watch
                    me and someone else do a mock interview and then have to complete one themselves with a partner.
                    They
                    would have to act as they would in an actual interview with their posture, speak, and attitude. They
                    would feel some sense of nerves which would make it more authentic to how an actual interview would
                    be.
                    They would learn how it is to ask interview questions and what they view as distracting or not
                    proper
                    and then apply it to how they answer questions as well. They would be modeling myself as well as
                    their
                    partner, learning from more than one person. I would have enough expertise to lead the demonstration
                    because of my Career Center position. I also would have the room setup so everyone could see and
                    hear my
                    mock interview example.

                Assessment: Entry and Exit Tickets (Barkley & Major, 2016 pp. 91-95)
                <p>
                    For the formative assessment, I would have students fill out an entry ticket to gauge how
                    comfortable
                    they are with interviews before the demonstration. After the demonstration, I would then have them
                    fill
                    out an exit ticket to see how their comfortability with interviewing changed. This would allow me to
                    see
                    their growth and if anything is still missing for their learning on the subject in the next class, I
                    could cover it again. There would be little preparation and implementation, but analysis on the
                    student’s responses.
