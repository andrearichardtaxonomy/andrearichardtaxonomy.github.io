                Instructional Model: Mentorship (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 451-469)
                <p>
                    A mentor is someone who is there to help support, challenge and give vision to a student. The act of
                    mentorship can help not only the student being mentored but also the mentor themselves. A student
                    must
                    also feel they are being encouraged and at the same level as the mentor, never that they are less or
                    being looked down upon. A mentor must always balance the amount of support and challenge given as to
                    not
                    push a student away. Understanding a student fully helps mentorship become more meaningful. The role
                    model aspect of mentorship allows a mentor to grow and feel satisfaction in what they are doing as
                    well
                    as provide comfort to the person being mentored. A student should be held accountable for their
                    actions
                    and to improve, but always feel if they need something the mentor will be there to assist and guide
                    them
                    with support or advice.

                Application:
                <p>
                    An application of mentorship is my role at the Career Center. I act as a mentor to any student who
                    enters the Career Center. I help them with whatever career related needs they have and then lead
                    them
                    through the process to succeed. I often explain terminology or where I have gotten my information
                    from
                    to help them feel comfortable and understand the topic further rather than just prescribing
                    information.
                    I also do a lot of listening in order to fully help the student. A lot of times students who come in
                    don’t really know why they came, so making sure they fully talk out their concerns is very important
                    to
                    ensure their success. When reviewing resumes and cover letters, it is extremely important to stay
                    encouraging and positive, so the student doesn’t feel defeated or wrong at any time. My role has
                    also
                    helped me grow as a leader and mentor. I found my interest in higher education from the Career
                    Center
                    and feel accomplished every time I help a student with a document and hear they landed their dream
                    job.
                    I love being a part of their journey.

                Assessment: Entry and Exit Tickets (Barkley & Major, 2016 pp. 91-95)
                <p>
                    A form of formative assessment that the Career Center does is an exit survey. We have students fill
                    out
                    a quick exit survey at the end of their time at the center so that we can improve on any comments
                    they
                    leave and see if they got all their questions answered. Students seem to like it because they feel
                    their
                    voice is heard, and the mentors get to see what to improve or keep doing.
