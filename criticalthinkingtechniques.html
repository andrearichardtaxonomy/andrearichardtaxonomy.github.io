                Instructional Model: Critical Thinking Techniques (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 341-360)
                <p>
                    Critical thinking is a concept that is very difficult for students to grasp and is a lifelong
                    process.
                    Approaching topics lightly at first to introduce critical thinking is important, so students do not
                    feel
                    overwhelmed by possible “cultural suicide” that can occur. An instructor can do this in many ways
                    and
                    some of the examples given were critical debates, structured critical conversation, critical
                    reading,
                    scenario analysis, critical incident questionnaires, and modeling lectures to include critical
                    thinking.
                    There are many other ways to include critical thinking because critical thinking has many varying
                    levels. Critical thinking requires an instructor to be criticized to show a student they are human
                    and
                    don’t have all the answers either. It can then become a learning process for both the instructor and
                    the
                    learner. As a learner gains critical thinking skills, they may feel differently about topics,
                    family,
                    and friends. It is important for the instructor to make learners feel that their lives are just more
                    informed, and they can still value the people in their lives and their ideas too.

                Application:
                <p>
                    As an intro course is a students’ first experience in a university setting learning about a
                    university,
                    I think it is important to include critical thinking in all the activities. One specifically that I
                    could do would be the critical incident questionnaires after we have completed an activity. I think
                    it
                    would be useful for the students to understand the material deeper and apply it to their current
                    education and life, while also helping me improve as an instructor as well. I would have them fill
                    out
                    the sheet of paper or have them post on blackboard after class at the end of the week and I would
                    review
                    them before the next class period.
                </p>

                Assessment:
                <p>
                    The critical incident questionnaire would be a form of formative assessment as the student would be
                    critically thinking and reflecting and it would show me what they are and are not getting out of the
                    course. This would allow me to change how I am presenting information before the end, and also give
                    the
                    students a chance to change their approach to the course by reflecting on what is and isn’t working
                    for
                    them. It would be heavy on the analysis side, but the benefits of understanding their learning would
                    be
                    a great opportunity for me as an instructor.
