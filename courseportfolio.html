                Instructional Method: Course Portfolios (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 321-340)
                <p>
                    A portfolio is used by someone to demonstrate what they view as most important. The items in the
                    portfolio are put in by their own choosing to show specific skills and knowledge. A folio on the
                    other
                    hand is more open and involves an accumulation of all the student’s work. These can be used for a
                    specific course, project, or position they are applying for. Portfolio and folios are used to
                    demonstrate a student’s growth and development in their chosen profession. These allow a student to
                    measure their own learning and take the attention off of the professor and onto the student
                    themselves.
                    Portfolios contain four elements: the introduction, demonstration, reflection, and conclusion. The
                    introduction is a statement about how they met their goals and the growth that they experiences.
                    This is
                    followed by demonstration which consists of what they actually did. Reflection goes into depth about
                    how
                    they learned and were able to complete the portfolio as well as how it has helped improve
                    themselves.
                    Conclusion is then the final statement describing their learning experience and how it developed
                    throughout creating the portfolio.

                Application:
                <p>
                    For an introductory university course, a folio would be very useful. I would have students complete
                    one
                    with their future learning in mind. I would require that students put any relevant assignments from
                    the
                    course in the folio, but then continue to use it throughout their education for more than just
                    coursework. They can have their plan of study they discuss with their advisor, a sheet of required
                    classes for their major and minor, general education requirements, their transcripts, scholarship
                    information, any awards they receive, and then any relevant learning experiences. This would allow
                    students to be able to reference back on their experiences throughout their education and know what
                    they
                    have accomplished. The folio would also be useful when going to advising appointments because they
                    will
                    have all their information right there. The folio would also have the introductory statement,
                    documentation, and reflection relevant to the introductory course, but they could always add to it
                    for
                    future courses.

                Assessment: Muddiest Point (Angelo & Cross, 1993, pp. 154-158)
                <p>
                    For my formative assessment, I would frequently do the muddiest point with the students to make sure
                    the
                    folio project was working for them. I would do it every few weeks before or after class with the
                    open-ended question “What is the muddiest point about the folio at this point? that they could turn
                    into
                    me on a sheet of paper. I would collect the paper and spend more time analyzing it because I want
                    the
                    students to be clear on the assignment and feel free to ask questions. I could also meet with any
                    students who seem to be struggling more in order to be more approachable to students.
