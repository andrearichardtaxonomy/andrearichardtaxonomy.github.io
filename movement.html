                Instructional Method: Movement (Tate, 2012, pp. 71-77)
                <p>
                    Movement in the classroom is very important for students to be actively engaged in the learning. The
                    more movement involved the more attention the student is paying to the activity and the higher
                    chance of
                    retention. Movement allows whatever is being done to go into procedural memory, so it is more easily
                    remembered. If students can have their information go into procedural memory, they would have no
                    issues
                    recalling information later for a test or just for an activity. Movement has to be related to the
                    material, so that students are kept on task and don’t use it as an excuse to check-out mentally from
                    the
                    activity. Having something required while they are moving is essential to the success of movement in
                    the
                    classroom.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    An application of a movement activity in an intro level class would be if everyone was standing in a
                    circle in the classroom and I had a beach ball with questions written about the topic we are
                    learning.
                    The students would pass the ball around the room and wherever their two fingers landed they had to
                    answer one of those questions. This would keep the students engaged and enjoying the material, while
                    also allowing them to share what they have been learning with the class. I could have music playing
                    in
                    the background to improve everyone’s mood as well. The students who are not as outgoing would still
                    enjoy this activity because of the environment around it and also everyone being comfortable with
                    one
                    another. They would be standing and throwing the ball which would be engaging their procedural
                    memory,
                    increasing retention.

                Assessment: Muddiest Point (Angelo & Cross, 1993, 154-158)
                <p>
                    For this activity, it is a form of formative assessment itself, but it would also be useful to know
                    what
                    the students are still confused about after the activity. If I did muddiest point, I would be able
                    to
                    see what they need clarified and then introduce in the next class period. It also would be a way for
                    them to reflect on the activity and what all they have learned from the lesson.
