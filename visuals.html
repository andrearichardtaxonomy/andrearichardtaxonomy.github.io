                Instructional Method: Visuals (Tate, 2012, pp. 115-119)
                <p>
                    Visuals in a classroom can be incorporated in many ways. From having a PowerPoint, to a white board,
                    or
                    poster, or using a document camera. As long as a student is looking at something and engaging their
                    brain the visual is being used. Visuals allow the student to understand a concept by actually
                    looking at
                    it rather than picturing it in their heads or just hearing the information. As Tate says, effects of
                    visuals increase after 2 weeks, but direct instruction diminishes. Studentsâ€™ remember visuals
                    because
                    they are able to actually see it and remember that image.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    An application of visuals could be for every class during an introductory course. One that is
                    sticking
                    out to me is from when I was a peer mentor for the HDE 191 course. The instructor was teaching how
                    to
                    balance your schedule by writing things in a planner. In order to make it clear how to use your
                    planner,
                    she put her planner under the document camera and showed them her semester schedule. This allowed
                    the
                    students to see exactly what she meant and how it can be different depending on the person. The
                    visual
                    of the actual planner made the concept relatable and applicable to their lives, making them more
                    excited
                    about actually using their planners. For the rest of the class, she had them fill in their own
                    planners
                    using their syllabi and any work schedules they have. They all seemed to enjoy the activity and
                    fully
                    understood the topic.
                </p>

                Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 105-110)
                <p>
                    I would have the students complete a quick write on what they find useful or not useful about using
                    a
                    planner. This would allow me to analyze how many students felt they would actually use a planner and
                    how
                    many may have been disengaged throughout the lecture. I would also be able to clarify during the
                    next
                    class period any concepts or concerns that came up about using their planner.
