                Instructional Method: Distance Learning Techniques (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 273-288)
                <p>
                    Distance education is the use of technology at a distance to connect learners to other learners, the
                    instructor, and the community involved in the course. Distance education unlike ITV is not in
                    real-time
                    and for that reason the proper use of technology is vital for its success. The instructor has
                    different
                    responsibilities in this set-up, such as sending feedback only through email, a platform like
                    Blackboard, or through a video system like Tegrity. It is not as instanteous of a response and has
                    to be
                    frequent to keep learners engaged. Distance education allows for a course to be more learner
                    centered
                    rather than teacher centered due to the amount of self-directed learning available. This makes the
                    instructor’s role more of a facilitator and guide in the learning process. With more self-directed
                    learning, there still must be set outcomes for the course outlined for the learner’s to understand
                    what
                    is expected of them. Engagement between learners is also different because it is not real-time and
                    must
                    be done online. The learners can use discussion boards, email, or videos to communicate and
                    experience
                    the collaboration within a group. Issues can occur with lack of familiarity with technology or if
                    technology doesn’t corporate. The instructor must be understanding and also knowledgeable in order
                    to
                    avoid more difficult situations due to technology failures and errors.

                Application:
                <p>
                    For this instructional method since intro courses are not taught online in most cases, I considered
                    an
                    online course about preparing for a career that could be taught to students through the Career
                    Center. I
                    thought something like FlipGrid could be very useful in this case. The students would be able to
                    interact with one another as well as the instructor. I could post frequent prompts for them to
                    respond
                    to and they would have to interact with their classmates for credit. They would get to be involved
                    with
                    one another and also share their opinions on the course material. I could post feedback to students
                    separately, so that there would be some privacy and a personal connection to the responses.
                </p>

                Assessment: Role Play (Barkley & Major, 2016 pp. 292-297)
                <p>
                    One example of an interaction they could have over FlipGrid would be role playing an interview. They
                    could post interview questions and then their classmates would have to respond to at least five of
                    their
                    classmates with an answer and would only have a certain amount of time. This would teach them to
                    make
                    their answers more succinct and also, they would watch themselves to get rid of their nervous tics
                    that
                    can develop. They would also have to dress accordingly for an interview and act as professional as
                    they
                    would in real-life. After they had responded to classmates, we could have a discussion in another
                    prompt
                    about how it went and if they did as well as expected/what could they improve on? I would also grade
                    their interactions giving them feedback on how they did following the Situation/Task Action Result
                    (STAR) method. This would give students practice as well as feedback from me as the professor to
                    make
                    improvements. I think the preparation would be low on my part because the students would be
                    responsible
                    for the preparation and the implementation. The analysis on my part would be high, but worth it to
                    see
                    how they have taken to the concepts and if they are fully grasping what is being discussed.
