                Instructional Method: Brainstorming and Discussion (Tate, 2012, pp. 11-19)
                <p>
                    Brainstorming and discussion is a very important method when considering self-directed learning.
                    During
                    a discussion, a learner has the opportunity to work on their own questions and have the opportunity
                    to
                    hear other’s discussions on that topic. The learner may think of things they never would have
                    before,
                    and they have the opportunity to provide that to someone else as well. Discussion is a classroom has
                    to
                    be implemented with an open-minded and safe atmosphere for people to participate. The learners have
                    to
                    feel comfortable with the professor and also with the other learners. Everyone’s ideas have to be
                    valued
                    and heard in order for the best discussions to occur. Differing opinions is a major advantage with
                    discussion and therefore, it must be thought of as so. If learners argue instead of having a
                    thoughtful
                    discussion, the point of the session is lost, and the learners have lost an opportunity as well.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    Brainstorming and discussion could have many uses in an intro course, but one that would really
                    benefit
                    learners is an activity involving interviewing techniques. After a lesson on interviewing
                    techniques, I
                    would have an interview question on each wall and then split the students up into groups of three.
                    They
                    would go to each question and one person in the group would ask the question, one would answer, and
                    the
                    other would record what was discussed. Each group would go to each question switching their roles as
                    they go. After they have gotten each question and role, they would return to the full group and we
                    would
                    discuss how the activity went. The reporters would say what they thought went well and what could
                    have
                    been improved and then the person who was interviewed could do the same. This would allow the
                    learners
                    to refer back to what we had learned and then apply that to the real-life application of it.

                Assessment: Muddiest Point (Angelo & Cross, 1993, pp. 154-158)
                <p>
                    For my formative assessment, I would frequently do the muddiest point on a sheet of paper after the
                    discussion. This would allow me to hear from the students who were maybe too shy during the large
                    group
                    discussion. This would involve little preparation and implementation, but the analysis would be very
                    useful when considering what the students had taken away from the discussion and activity.
