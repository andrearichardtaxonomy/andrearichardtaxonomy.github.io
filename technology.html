                Instructional Method: Technology (Tate, 2012, pp. 105-109)

                <p>
                    Technology in the classroom can take many forms and has evolved over time. When incorporating
                    technology
                    in the classroom the learners as well as the instructor have to change their thinking and mindset
                    surrounding the classroom experience. Technology at its smallest form doesn’t typically involve much
                    practice or initial training such as bringing a laptop to class or watching a video. When you start
                    introducing more software like online discussion boards incorporating videos, or sharing platforms,
                    or
                    clicker devices, it can be difficult to initially use these, and more training and instruction may
                    be
                    necessary to fully grasp it. Technology in the classroom has many benefits including reaching
                    students
                    that may not have access otherwise, incorporating real-life applications, building future skills,
                    and
                    allowing more innovation. The drawbacks of course are that technology isn’t always reliable, access
                    isn’t always possible for students, and the amount of professional development involved in learning
                    the
                    applications can be cumbersome. Technology is not going anywhere and to reach learners best we need
                    to
                    incorporate it in the classroom.

                Application:

                <p>
                    During an intro class, I could have the students meet at a computer lab or bring their own laptops
                    in
                    order to demonstrate how to sign up for classes while letting them have the opportunity to do it
                    themselves at the same time. This would allow them to be hands-on and ask questions throughout the
                    demonstration. If they had issues, they could also refer to the people surrounding them and learn
                    more
                    on their own rather than me explaining it all to them. Since I would most likely be at least some of
                    their advisor, this would help me not have so many emails with questions, and provide students the
                    tools
                    to sign up for classes on their own when it came time in the future.

                Assessment: Red Light…Green Light (Ralf, 2015)

                <p>
                    As I would be the advisor for most of the students, I would know if they had registered for classes
                    and
                    therefore the assessment would be in if they completed it or not. There could be ways to make sure
                    they
                    are understanding the demonstration by doing red light green light. They would each have a green and
                    red
                    paper, cup, or marker even that they could have on their table throughout the demonstrations. After
                    each
                    step, I could look around and see if they understood the subject and are ready to move on or if they
                    needed more time and had questions. This would allow me to know at what pace to explain the process
                    and
                    also to see if the students are following and if they are even paying attention.
