                Instructional Method: Metaphors, Analogies, and Similes (Tate, 2012, pp. 59-63)
                <p>
                    A metaphor defined is a word or phrase that is applied to an object in a figurative manner. A simile
                    is
                    a comparison of two different things using like or as. Analogy is a comparison of two different
                    things
                    without the use of like or as. This instructional method involves teaching a new concept and then
                    reaffirming that concept with a metaphor, analogy, or simile so the learner fully grasps it. When
                    doing
                    activities that involve memorization of key concepts, this method would be very useful because the
                    learner would have another way to remember it. This also helps because when you associate a concept
                    with
                    another word or task it implants in the brain better to allow for more long-term memory, so they
                    don’t
                    forget the concepts after the lesson is over or after an examination.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    When teaching about careers and how it is more acceptable to job hop than it once was, it may be
                    useful
                    to use a metaphor and compare careers to a cycle or a roundabout. You go through the same process
                    over
                    and over – you apply for a job, get an interview, accept the job, and go through your day-to-day
                    work –
                    like a roundabout. At some point, you have to get out and exit the roundabout to get home or to meet
                    your professional goals, and that is okay. You just get back on the roundabout and repeat the
                    process
                    over again. An activity that I could have people do after understanding the metaphor, is create
                    their
                    own paths. I could have them draw roundabouts or cycles and put in where they are now in school and
                    then
                    what they want their next steps to be, what career they want and for how long, their stepping stone
                    positions. This would allow them to apply the cycle to their own life and see what they are wanting
                    out
                    of their career.
                </p>

                Assessment:
                <p>
                    I think this would be a form of formative assessment because they are showing me their understanding
                    by
                    drawing out their cycles of career and how they want to be as time goes on.
