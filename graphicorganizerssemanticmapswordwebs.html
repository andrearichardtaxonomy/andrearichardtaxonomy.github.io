                Instructional Method: Graphic Organizers, Semantic Maps, and Word Webs (Tate, 2012, pp. 37-45)
                <p>
                    Graphic organizers, semantic maps, and word webs allow students to visually show the connections
                    between
                    concepts, words, and ideas and seem to be a great way for learners to get their ideas out into a
                    more
                    visual concept. The learners can see the concepts in a new light and possibly understand them deeper
                    than if they had just been listed or written out in notes. They allow for a learner to also involve
                    both
                    the left and right hemispheres of the brain, which other activities don’t always allow for. A
                    learner
                    has more of an opportunity to show what they have learned, and the instructor can see where the gaps
                    are
                    based on the types of maps or organizers created. This instructional method also allows for
                    brainstorming on the learners part because of the amount of creativity involved in how to present
                    the
                    information that has been learned.
                    <p>

                        Application:
                        <p>
                            My application would most likely be during the time management class session. I would have
                            students
                            create a word web, sequence chart, or pie chart to show all the things they have to do in a
                            day and the
                            way that they prioritize those tasks. If they create two one of their ideal day and one of
                            the reality
                            of their day, they could see where they need to make changes to have better balance. This
                            would help
                            them visually see their day and be able to comprehend the amount of time they have rather
                            than just
                            talking or saying the things they do daily. They could reference this chart or web whenever
                            they are
                            having a hard time remembering their balance and need a refresher on their priorities.
                        </p>

                        Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 105-110)
                        <p>
                            I would do a quick write as my formative assessment for this project. My question would be,
                            “what is the
                            hardest part of prioritizing your day?” This would allow me to see what they are struggling
                            with still
                            and if I can help provide any further assistance in explaining how they can balance their
                            lives and
                            schedules. I could cover this in the next class period and maybe have a discussion about
                            common themes
                            that I found.
