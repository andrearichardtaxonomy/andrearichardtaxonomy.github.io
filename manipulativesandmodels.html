                Instructional Model: Manipulatives and Models (Tate, 2012, pp. 53-58)
                <p>
                    Manipulatives and models as an instructional method allow the learner to take what they have learned
                    and
                    apply it hands-on. They connect the “mind and body” so that they are utilizing multiple parts of
                    their
                    brain. If they can relate a topic to something they actually have done, it is easier to remember in
                    the
                    future and use a real-life application. This activity allows the learner to work with others, so if
                    they
                    don’t fully understand the concept, they can work off of each other and improve their skills as
                    well.
                    Learners also have the opportunity to share their work and see others, so they can make connections
                    to
                    how they could have improved as well as what they did better.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    An application of a model used in an intro course, could be during a class where we are looking
                    different departments on campus and what their role is for each student. I would have a map of
                    campus
                    blown up and without any labels. The students would then have to fill out the map with building
                    names
                    and also the buildings function and purpose. This activity would be after a campus tour and
                    discussions
                    about their roles, so it wouldn’t be completely new concepts to the students. For the first 5-10
                    minutes
                    of the activity they wouldn’t be allowed to use any technology, but after that amount of time they
                    could
                    use the internet for 5-10 minutes. After that amount of time they could use other people around the
                    room
                    to get ideas and compare their models. Since they have to have the functions, it would be useful to
                    use
                    the NDSU website to look up departments and they would understand the functions even further. This
                    would
                    involve group work, collaboration, time management, and also applying what they have learned in
                    person
                    to an actual model.
                </p>

                Assessment:
                <p>
                    The application I believe also works as a formative assessment because the students are showing
                    their
                    understanding of the material throughout their creation of the model, and I can clarify questions to
                    a
                    certain extent without giving away answers. There would be little preparation to create the maps
                    themselves, but a decent chunk of in class implementation for them to actually complete the
                    assignment.
                    The analysis would be fairly high since there are so many parts to it, but it would show me what
                    they
                    didn’t understand and what needed further explanation.
