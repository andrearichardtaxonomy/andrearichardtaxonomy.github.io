                Instructional Method: Storytelling (Tate, 2012, pp. 101-104)
                <p>
                    Storytelling is a great way to get the concept being taught cemented in learner’s minds. Hearing an
                    example or story of a specific real-world situation where the concept occurred makes the information
                    applicable to the learner causing them to remember it best. Emotions can have a major affect on how
                    someone remembers a concept. If they remember how it made them feel, they may remember more than
                    just
                    from hearing it defined. Storytelling also lets learners have a break from actively learning and
                    they
                    can instead listen or engage in storytelling themselves. They don’t even know they are learning as
                    much
                    as they are. As Tate talks about, it puts a face to success, which allows a learner to know it is
                    possible and they can do it too.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    An application of this would be telling a personal story about interviewing experiences. I could
                    either
                    give them an example of my previous interviews that were good or bad and if they seem to have them
                    themselves, they could all share with one another as well. This would be a great way to start the
                    interviewing section of the course, and to help them remember what they personally did good or bad
                    and
                    then apply that to what we learn about interviewing.
                </p>

                Assessment: Entry and Exit Tickets (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 91-95)
                <p>
                    For my formative assessment, I would do entry and exit tickets for the interviewing section. I would
                    have them write their good and bad interviewing experience down for their entry ticket. For the exit
                    ticket I would have them write down what they would change about how they interviewed in the past
                    for
                    their bad interview and anything that stuck out from the lesson that they didn’t know before. The
                    analysis would be highest with this assessment. I would need to look at all of them and see what
                    they
                    had learned and if there was anything that needed to be revisited next class.
