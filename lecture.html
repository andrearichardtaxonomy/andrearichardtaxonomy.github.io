                Instructional Model: Lecture (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 227-252)
                <p>
                    Lecturing as an instructional method is one of the most popular methods, but is involves a lot to be
                    most effective. The responsibility is entirely on the instructor to make sure they are presenting
                    the
                    most relatable material in a timely manner, speaking coherently, moving around, allowing the asking
                    of
                    questions, and the taking every experience and improving their lecture style. Lecture is not
                    necessary
                    or possible with every lesson that needs to be taught, so instructors need to be aware of the
                    limitations of lecturing. A lecture provides a lot information in a short amount of time that needs
                    to
                    be recalled later and allows the student to learn from an “expert” on the topic. The student needs
                    to be
                    able to hear, see, and understand the instructor in order for this to work. Adjusting the classroom
                    seating, getting a better classroom, using visuals or sound can all assist in improving the
                    presentation
                    of the lecture. Planning the lecture before the class is essential for its success. Knowing your
                    time
                    and what could be adapted if that changes can help the instructor be more in the moment during the
                    lecture to appear more comfortable. Since a lecture is typically done with more students, it is
                    important that interaction is still involved through an activity, questions, feedback, or just
                    breaking
                    up the heavy material with a visual. A lecture is only as useful as the preparation that is put into
                    it.

                Application:
                <p>
                    For an intro course, a lecture could be useful when doing a lesson learning styles and study
                    strategies.
                    The students are most likely unfamiliar with these to extent I would like them to know, and I want
                    them
                    to learn from a trusted source, since it is so up in the air currently. The lecture would be visual
                    and
                    auditory, since I would have slides with visuals on it as well as I would be going through the
                    slides. I
                    would most likely have had them do the VARK inventory before coming to class, so they would have an
                    idea, but not be an expert on the subject. The lecture would allow me to present the information to
                    the
                    students in a succinct manner, allowing for questions throughout or after and giving them a chance
                    to
                    absorb their assignment.
                </p>

                Assessment: Discussion (Galbraith, 2004 pp. 209-226)
                <p>
                    I would most likely do a discussion or reflection activity as the formative assessment, so that they
                    would be able to apply what I had just taught and fully understand the purpose of learning about
                    their
                    own learning style. The discussion would take preparation to formulate questions and then the
                    implementation would take a chunk of class time, but the information I would get about their
                    learning
                    would be worth the extra time.
