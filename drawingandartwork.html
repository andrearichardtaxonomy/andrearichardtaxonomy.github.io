                Instructional Method: Drawing and Artwork (Tate, 2012, pp. 21-24)
                <p>
                    Drawing and artwork in the classroom are extremely useful for learners to get their creative energy
                    out
                    and even remember the information. Drawing can help learners mentally process the information given
                    to
                    them and then remember it later. Drawing is also a way to get learns to be excited about the
                    material
                    because it is a break from the typical note taking or assignments given and allows for brainstorming
                    and
                    creativity to come out. Adults especially need to learn to use their imagination like they once did
                    and
                    express themselves through other avenues.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    Drawing could be involved in many ways in an introductory level course. One specific example could
                    be
                    having the students create a drawing of the university in a group and then present it to the class.
                    The
                    drawing would have to include certain aspects about campus such as the buildings, purposes of
                    buildings,
                    and maybe some extra things like parking lots or scenery around campus. They would have to color and
                    make the drawing look appealing to the audience as well. The presentations would allow everyone to
                    see
                    other interpretations of the assignment as well as a guide for me as to how they did with the
                    assignment
                    and if there are any further confusions.
                </p>

                Assessment:
                <p>
                    For the assessment, I think having the students present would be enough because of the amount of
                    assessing I could do of their learning from what they create and how well they understand the topic.
                    The
                    analysis would be the most intensive part just making sure they completed all the necessary parts
                    and
                    presented well.
