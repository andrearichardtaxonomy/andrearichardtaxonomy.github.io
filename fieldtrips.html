                Instructional Method: Field Trips (Tate, 2012, pp. 25-29)
                <p>
                    Field trips are a way for learners to experience the content in a new way. If you are to do a field
                    trip
                    it must be related to the material, so that learners can easily see its purpose and value to them.
                    Field
                    trips can be done by leaving the classroom and visiting somewhere on the campus or around the
                    community,
                    as well as through distance technology for things that are too far away or people that are not able
                    to
                    travel. Another option is to have the “field trip” come to the classroom. Guest speakers are useful
                    real-life application and allow students to learn content in a new way. Field trips must be an
                    attainable distance away and there needs to be some level of safety for students as well. If you
                    need a
                    bus, or the students need material to take with them there needs to be a certain amount of time in
                    advance for people to prepare and have a warning.

                Application:
                <p>
                    For this method, I could have my intro class go around campus with a map to the different
                    departments.
                    The difference between this and a typical scavenger hunt is that there would be riddles and QR codes
                    at
                    each place they are led to. The riddles would involve not only the location of the building but also
                    the
                    purpose of that building. For example, for ARC I could have a riddle involving its location and then
                    a
                    QR code that shows a picture related to the purpose of the building such as a change your major
                    form.
                    They would then go to that building and either take a picture or pick something up to prove they
                    were
                    there. This would involve a lot of work on my part, but it would be incredible how much they would
                    learn
                    compared to a scavenger hunt.

                Assessment: Muddiest Point (Angelo & Cross, 1993, pp. 154-158)
                <p>
                    For the formative assessment, doing muddiest point would be useful, so that the students could
                    reflect
                    on the experience and I could get feedback on anything that needs improving or that worked well. The
                    preparation is low, as well as the implementation, but the analysis would be vital for the success
                    of
                    the assignment in the future.
