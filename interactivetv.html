                Instructional Method: Interactive Television (Galbraith, 2004, pp. 253-271)
                <p>
                    Interactive television, which is also called ITV, is a distance learning technique used in many
                    educational institutions. ITV allows students to be a part of the classroom even from a distance.
                    The
                    classroom has a screen as well as the student in a distance location that allow them to connect
                    during
                    the class time. This process allows students from miles away or students with limited availability
                    for
                    on campus courses to learn and achieve the face-to-face aspect of the classroom experience. ITV is
                    real-time so the instructor can still form a relationship with the student and get feedback from the
                    student in person rather than online. The ITV experience is still different than a classroom setting
                    and
                    does involve the instructor being prepared for each class much in advance. Since the students aren’t
                    in
                    the same classroom, they must send materials online instead of giving them out in person and they
                    also
                    have to accept all the materials online. Having students in person and over ITV can change the
                    dynamic
                    of the classroom. It is vital the instructor is aware of the new dynamic and will change the course
                    interaction accordingly.

                Application:
                <p>
                    As an advisor teaching an introductory university course, the students would all be
                    freshmen therefore, many of them wouldn’t have an issue being in person. If online programs were
                    required to be a part of the introductory courses then IVN would be useful, but it may not be
                    applicable
                    to the students off campus. So, I decided to think about a past experience instead of future one. In
                    high school I took a dual-credit college course called Music Appreciation over ITV. The course was
                    very
                    lecture based with PowerPoint slides being sent before class and very little interaction as a class.
                    The
                    course had very few projects as well just quizzes and tests throughout the course. If there had been
                    more opportunity to test our knowledge besides tests that were more engaging, it may have made the
                    course more enjoyable.

                Assessment: Entry and Exit Tickets (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp. 91-95)
                <p>
                    I thought since the course involved very little interaction and feedback, that maybe including
                    anonymous
                    entry and exit tickets would be useful. As the instructor, I would send or post a link to a survey
                    before and after class that students would complete in order to see if they are understanding the
                    material or have any feedback for me as an instructor. I would also be able to ask them questions to
                    see
                    their knowledge before the lecture and then compare to after. This would involve some preparation
                    for
                    the questions but, very little class time. There would be more analysis, so that I could properly
                    utilize the information given to me through the surveys.
