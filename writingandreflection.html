                Instructional Method: Writing and Reflection (Tate, 2012, pp.127-131)
                <p>
                    Writing and reflection is a useful technique that allows the learner to be consciously learning the
                    material in order to be able to remember it later. This method involves learners in either group or
                    individual reflection over the material they just learned so that instructors can make sure they
                    understand what was needed to know from the lesson that occurred. The method can be done through
                    writing
                    short words or phrases, concept mapping, group discussion, or a reflection paper of the material
                    covered. Reflecting on the material helps cement what was most important or relatable to the learner
                    and
                    allows the instructor to know where the learners are at in the learning process.

                    Writing and Reflection allows learners to be able to share ideas with others and gain new
                    perspective on
                    the learning they may not have had before, but also, could be used for individual reflection, so
                    students can voice their opinion and not feel fear of judgement.

                Application:
                <p>
                    In an introductory university course, a lot of the information is lecture based because you are
                    giving
                    them information they have never heard or seen before. Writing and reflection as a learning
                    technique
                    would be very useful due to the ability that learners would have to digest the information and show
                    that
                    they have gotten the point of the lesson. For an example of how this technique could be used, if we
                    had
                    a lesson on study techniques, I could give a few presentation slides with pictures and few words to
                    the
                    students on the board as well as on Blackboard or a handout option. I would tell the students to
                    answer
                    the open-ended prompt of how they could utilize the strategy after I discuss each one. Once they
                    have
                    wrote a few down individually, I would have them get into pairs and share with one another and add
                    to
                    their current list or make changes to their ideas. This would incorporate learning of the material,
                    individual work, as well as collaboration with group mates. I could also be walking around the room
                    at
                    this point and answer any questions that students have or clarify if there are any questions after
                    the
                    discussion is over.

                Assessment: Quick Write (Barkley & Major, 2016, pp.105-110)
                <p>
                    The formative assessment I would use in this situation would be a quick write to collect the notes
                    they
                    had taken individually and edited in a group to be able to see how they are taking in the
                    information.
                    If I noticed there were any inconsistencies or confusion, I would then cover that information in the
                    next class. This would take very little preparation and would be heavier on the analysis side. I
                    think
                    it would be worth the extra time because I would be able to see if they understood the material,
                    which
                    is most important in this type of course.
