                Instructional Method: Visualization and Guided Imagery (Tate, 2012, pp. 111-114)
                <p>
                    Visualization is a tactic used to visualize success. Picturing something in your mind can help you
                    not
                    only remember it but can build confidence because your body is associating the picture with what
                    will
                    actually happen. It seems to be similar to positive thinking. If you positively associate a
                    situation in
                    your head, you are more likely to be successful in that situation in the future. I think this is
                    extremely important for a student to be successful at doing because it allows them to build
                    confidence
                    in themselves and avoid negative thoughts.
                </p>

                Application:
                <p>
                    My application would be during a study tactic class. I would have students visualize themselves
                    doing
                    well on their upcoming test. Specifically, having them think about the preparation of the test,
                    walking
                    to the classroom, having all their supplies, and filling out the test, then turning it in and
                    feeling
                    confident. They will then associate that test with positive thoughts, and their studying will be
                    more
                    positive as well. Students who are more nervous for tests, may feel less anxiety about it because
                    they
                    have positive thoughts and have planned in their head how it will go. Thinking about upcoming tests
                    early on in their coursework may be useful when it comes time for midterm or finals. They will have
                    a
                    positive response to their stress about larger exams that will take place in the future.

                Assessment: Muddiest Point (Angelo & Cross, 1993, pp. 154-158)
                <p>
                    I would have students do a muddiest point after they visualized themselves preparing for their test.
                    I
                    would ask what is the muddiest point about visualization, what do they still feel when thinking
                    about
                    their test. This would allow me to see if they found it useful and if they actually put in effort to
                    allow it to be useful for them. If there was something that needed to be clarified, I could do so
                    the
                    next class period.
